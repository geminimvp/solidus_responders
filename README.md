**This gem provides legacy support for an interface [removed from Solidus 2.4.0](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1956), we don't recommend adding it to new stores**

Solidus Responders
==============

Solidus responders allows customizing and overriding responders within solidus.
For more information about responders, see the responders gem:

[plataformatec/responders](https://github.com/plataformatec/responders)

Installation
------------

Add solidus_responders to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_responders'
```

Bundle your dependencies:

```shell
bundle
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs, and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```
